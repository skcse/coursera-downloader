# coursera-downloader
script for downloading coursera enrolled courses

This script is modified form of https://github.com/jansenicus/www-coursera-downloader/blob/master/WWW-COURSERA-DOWNLOADER.ipynb
somehow,
"sectionsection[[chosen_coursechosen_c -1].click()" was not working for me.

Note: If some of the packages of python is not installed, then RUN "!pip install name of package " in jupyter notebook.
